__Hello!__
And welcome to my new and hopefully _fancy_ blog!
I am so excited to be able to put this out finally!

It has been a pleasure working on this project for the past few days
Learning about netlify, jekyll, Let's Encrypt, namecheap. All that good stuff!

But here we are! With my first blog post here!

Now, the blog is definitely not finished. Missing features are:
* Categories
* Showing Categories for each post
* About page
* Design
* Syntax Highlighting
* Favicons
* _and quite more..._

But I am excited to finally have something that I am proud of and be able to show it to
people I meet and be like, yeah, I created that.

So yeah! I am going to close of this post with a promise:
To continue working and update you regurarly with my projects, life and more!

Until next time, see ya!
