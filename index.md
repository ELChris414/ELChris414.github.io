# Hub
* This is the ELChris414 Github Hub.
* This will *probably* not be updated very frequently.

### Repositories
* [__Pycraft:__](https://github.com/ELChris414/PyCraft "Pycraft") an old (but still pretty relevant) python library that helps you access Minecraft and Mojang APIs easily
* [__EverySpam:__](https://github.com/ELChris414/EverySpam "EverySpam") an old awful python twitter bot
* [__Dalon:__](https://github.com/ELChris414/Dalon "Dalon") a very old mod that I don't work on anymore (and never worked)
* [__Elrand:__](https://github.com/ELChris414/Elrand "Elrand") a very old mod that I don't work on anymore but has some craftable and needo stuff!

### Currently Working
* Conway's Game Of Life (Processing)
* Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (Processing) (I have hope to implement a neural evolution bot for it)
